}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The object to be converted.
Should be of the class \code{cond_indirect_effects}
from the package \code{manymome}.}

\item{pvalue}{If bootstrap confidence
intervals are stored, whether
asymmetric \emph{p}-values are reported.
Default is \code{FALSE}.
See
\code{manymome::print.cond_indirect_effects()}
for the computational details.}

\item{se}{Whether standard errors
are reported if confidence intervals
are stored. Default is \code{TRUE}.
See
\code{manymome::print.cond_indirect_effects()}
for the computation details.}

\item{var_labels}{A named vectors.
Used to replace variable names by
other names when generating the
table. For example,
\code{c(x = "I.V", y = "D.V.")} replaces
\code{x} by \code{"I.V"} and \code{y} by \code{"D.V."}
in the output.}

\item{digits}{The number of digits
to be displayed for most numerical
columns,
such as effect estimates, standard
errors, and confidence intervals.
Default is 2.}

\item{pval_digits}{The number of
digits to be displayed for the
\emph{p}-value column, if present. Default
is 3.}

\item{use_arrow}{If \code{TRUE}, the
default, use the arrow symbol in
the paths.}

\item{indirect_raw}{If \code{TRUE}, the
default, report unstandardized effects
even if standardization was done.}

\item{indirect_raw_ci}{If \code{TRUE},
report the confidence intervals
of unstandardized effects
even if standardization was done
and confidence intervals were stored.
Default to be equal to \code{indirect_raw}.
NOTE: Not used for now. Always \code{FALSE}.}

\item{indirect_raw_se}{If \code{TRUE},
report the standard errors
of unstandardized effects
even if standardization was done
and confidence intervals were stored.
Default to be equal to \code{indirect_raw}.
NOTE: Not used for now. Always \code{FALSE}.}

\item{footnote}{If \code{TRUE}, the
default,
add footnote(s) regarding the results
to the bottom of the table.}

\item{show_wvalues}{Whether the values
of moderators will be shown. If \code{FALSE},
no values will be shown, even for
categorical moderators. Default is
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{show_indicators}{Whether the values
of indicators (dummy variables) will
be shown for categorical moderators.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{show_path}{Whether the paths
being moderated will be displayed.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{pcut}{Any \emph{p}-value less than
\code{pcut} will be displayed as
\verb{<[pcut]}, \code{"[pcut]"} replaced by
the value of \code{pcut}. Default is .001.}

\item{level}{The level of confidence
for the confidence intervals computed
from the original standard errors
(e.g., the standard errors in
\code{\link[stats:lm]{stats::lm()}} or \code{lavaan}).
Used only for paths without mediators
and both x- and y-variables are not
standardized. Default is .95.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.
To be passed to \code{\link[flextable:autofit]{flextable::autofit()}}
in preparing the final table. For
example, if some lines are too lone
and wrapped, try adding \code{add_w = .2}.}
}
\value{
A \code{flextable} object.
}
\description{
The 'as_flextable' method
for the output of 'manymome::many_indirect_effects()'.
}
\details{
It converts an \code{cond_indirect_effects}
object,
which is usually created by
\code{\link[manymome:cond_indirect]{manymome::cond_indirect_effects()}},
to a \code{flextable} object. The output
can be further modified by functions
from the \code{flextable} package.
